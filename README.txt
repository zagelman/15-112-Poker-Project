All the code in this repository was written in Spring 2022
Description:
The project is now called 5-card draw. 
It allows you to play the 5-card draw variant of poker by yourself against AI opponents 
or with up to 4 other human players playing against a remaining number of AI opponents
such that there are 5 total players.
There are two rounds of betting, and an opportunity for each player to switch up to 5 cards in their hand.
Players are allowed to start new rounds at the end of a previous one, and their money is preserved until they either close the game, 
or back out to the start menu to try something else.
How to run:
The project is run by running the file FinalProject.py with the files playerObject.py and playerLists.py in the same folder.
Libraries:
The program is using cs3 graphics, Pillow, and default Python libraries: random, copy, math, and itertools.
Shortcuts:
When more than one human player is playing, pressing space moves your view to the next active player and
holding tab shows your cards
Pressing a shows the name, hand, and score of hand of each player in the game.
